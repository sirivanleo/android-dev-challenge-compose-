    "bio": "He is a little fellow with loads of spunk. Say hello to Tofer, a sweet boy who is new to the big city and still adjusting to it. While he can be a little shy at times, especially on busy streets, he more than makes up for it with his personality. Tofer will greet you with a wagging tail and make you feel welcome. He enjoys the company of other small dogs and they have a grand time running around together. He is a good leash walker, but he does prefer quieter streets to be on. Each day will be loads of fun when he is in your home. If you are interested in meeting Tofer, please fill out the online pre-adoption form today.",

He doesn’t even mind if there are others frolicking on the other side of the fence. He’s not yet 100% comfortable with doorways, but he likes being on either side of them. He’s getting more confident each day and is enjoying the time he gets to hang out with folks. Remy is hoping his adopters come meet him soon, as he can’t wait to make himself comfortable in a home. Is that home yours? Please fill out the pre-adoption interest form if you’d like to learn more about Remy.",

He is always ready for lots of pets and he just gets so happy that he is grinning ear to ear as you pet him. Dante is a smart fellow and he already knows the command “sit”. He probably knows others and we just don’t know about them yet. He is happy to take treats and he is a big fan of ham if you have any to spare. This delightful boy is waiting to meet you.
