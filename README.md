# Adopt a Pupper
![Workflow result](https://github.com/sirivanleo/android-dev-challenge-compose-/workflows/Check/badge.svg)


## :scroll: Description
This app displays a list of dogs up for adoption at a nearby SPCA. All of the data is hardcoded except the images are loaded from the internet.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
This is my first time using compose and I was curious by its abilities. I am especially surprised at its power
to create customize layouts pretty quickly at a granular level like individual cards.
